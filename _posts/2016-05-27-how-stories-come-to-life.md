How Stories Come to Life

Stories become real when we _accept _them.

A story comes to life by various ways yet the most common is repetition. A story might be imagined by someone or be the product of a revelation yet in either case, if it is sufficiently _repeated_, the story will become real.

This is the important point: repetition. A false story (or a lie) will become real (true) if it is sufficiently repeated because repetition nourishes our brain.

How does the brain work? That depends on the side you are looking.

The right brain is all about intuition. It is the foundation of "right here, right now". It is the part of you that feels a trigger to pursue a passion, or to do something that might feel irrational. The right brain is your connection to what's real and to your inner voice.

Opposite to the right is obviously the left.

The left brain is all about thinking. It acts linearly between past and present and is always seeking to _understand_. The left brain is never "right here, right now". Its main function is to associate and categorize every detail of our lives, compare the information we gather with our past, project them in the future, explore all the possibilities we can think of, and seek to explain the experiences we are living.

The left brain does not like uncertainty and rather seeks order. It is this constant search for _order, for an explanation, _that makes the left brain so powerful. And where there is power, there is influence.

The left brain is that little voice that judges others and that overshadows our right brain and disconnects with the silent now.

The key in appreciating a story is recognizing which part of our brain is at work and most importantly, removing ourselves from our inner habit of wanting to explaining everything around us.
