On the story of Christ

I was baptized. I was initiated to the Catholic Church, which I attended early in my life. I have fond memories of listening to the Priest with my dad, someone who deeply believes in God and Christ.

My wife and I decided we would baptize our children, as a kind of legacy that we had received form our parents. Although we seldom practiced nor went to church, we did so out of respect for the teachings we had received. Accordingly, our first three children were baptized but by the time we got to the fourth, something happened. We no longer felt the need, nor the obligation to go through the ceremony that, in our view, no longer reflected who we had become. And so for our fourth child, we baptized him in our own special way, surrounding him with loved ones and in a manner that was reflective of him.

This said, after the birth of my fourth child, I reflected on whether or not God existed. I'm unsure how I started this reflection but something dawn on me concerning the man who allegedly came to earth some 2,000 years ago.

There is an old Yiddish proverb that says something like "A half truth is a whole lie". This proverb is quite liberating to apply because it enables you to eliminate any story that contains half-truths. In the case of Christ, we can actually state that he never existed. Period.

Some individuals want to believe Christ existed and are willing to make "leaps of faith".

First of all, the story about the Virgin Mary should in itself be sufficient to establish that Christ never existed. I don't need to discuss in length why biologically, a woman cannot conceive a child without a male partner. This should come as no surprise to anyone and no justification can undo this basic truth.And if the story isn't true, than the main actor isn't either.

The story of Christ goes as follows: a woman, without having any sexual relations, gives birth to a boy. Thirty years goes by before the boy embarks on a quest, a pilgrimage during which he will allegedly perform miracles of varying degrees. His actions and teachings will ultimately compel the authorities to view him as a threat. He will be tracked down and crucified. Days after his death, he will resurrect and await humanity at the end of times.

But let's say for arguments sake that we discounted the Virgin story, then how could we rationally accept that there are no formal recordings, _of any kind, _written during Christ's life? Surely someone as dangerous as Christ would have compelled__someone from within the authorities to write about him? There is no such thing. There are no historians of the time that have written about a man from Nazareth who performed miracles (actually, there was one, but his writings were revealed to be complete fabrications and frauds). What is that to say about the most important figure of all times?

The last aspect of the whole story of Christ remains the story itself. Are you aware the other mythical gods have the same story, almost identical to Christ himself? How could Christ's life, the most powerful supreme being of all times, share so many similarities with other gods? By reading about Dyonysus, Attis of Phrygia, and Horus (just to name a few), you will come to realize just how remarkably identical these stories are with one another. Why were these gods born from a Virgin? Why on December 25th? Why were there Three Kings? Why did he resurrect after three days? These questions, among others, can all be answered by astrology. I leave it up to you to seek answers, if you so wish.

With no formal recordings, no writings from the times, and identical aspects with other mythical gods, everyone should discard the whole story of Christ.

So why do individuals make these leaps of faith? Because it is convenient. And once you are willing to accept irrational stories once, you are open to do it again.
