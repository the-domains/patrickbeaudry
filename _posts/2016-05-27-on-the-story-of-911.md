On the story of 911

This is without a doubt the biggest external event that affected my life, as well as millions of other individuals. It is a story that everyone knows. When it happened, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

One day, a question popped in my mind: what if the story of 911 didn't happened the way we were told. Was there a part of the story that could undo the whole? And if so, would my view of the world change?

I'll be honest. When I seriously looked at this story, in the same manner that I looked at the story of Christ, I realized that the story _itself _required that I make a "leap of faith" in order for it to become real. I had to willingly accept in the impossible, just like I had to accept that a virgin could give birth to a child without conceiving it.

The story of 911 is identical to the story of Christ, because for us to make it true (to make it real), we must believe in something that is simply impossible.

The story of 911 is not mine and it is not yours. It's just a story we've been told. We either choose to accept it and rationalize all the suffering that ensued thereafter or we choose to trust the truth and distance ourselves from the emotional attachment this story created on that faithful day.

When I realized the obviousness of the truth, I felt liberated from a well-constructed lie. Initially, I felt really uncomfortable but in time, as I let go of the emotions that are "packaged" in this story, I was able to question everything related to it. I basically liberated myself from the story's consequences, while providing me another perspective on what our reality could be.

It's ironic to say, but on that fateful morning, I was completing my confirmation (a pre-requisite to any marriage under the laws of the Catholic Church). I spent a few hours with a Priest not talking about Christ nor God, but mostly about life and my views of it. It was a pleasant conversation that offered me time to think, while discussing with someone who thought critically and honestly about life in general.

As I stepped out of the Church, I was struck by two opposing feelings: one was the realization that I was starting a new chapter in my life and another one quite different, odd-like. Keep in mind smart phones didn't exist at the time yet it seemed I was connected to something that had happened but wasn't aware of.

I sat in my car, started the engine and as I drove to the nearest intersection, I turned the dial to my favorite rock station. Aerosmith's "Sweet Emotions" was playing. As I made my stop, turned right and drove towards my house, the odd feeling kept getting stronger and stronger, until the DJ took over the airwaves after the song had ended. He talked about an explosion that had occurred in NYC, explosion that seemed to occur in one of the World Trade Center towers. Details were sketchy and he seemed quite disturbed by the whole thing yet I didn't make much of it and rather pushed in The Matrix CD to hear "Wake Up" by Rage Against the Machine. I screamed at the top of my lungs with joy, as I realized I was about to get married. 

When I got home, I checked my emails and checked my "to do" list. I checked confirmation off of it and looked at the homework that needed completion (I was doing my Masters in Business Administration at the time). The phone rang. It was my sister.

"Do you see what's happening on TV?" she said.

"No" I replied.

I walked to the living room and turned on the TV, and I saw black smoke coming out of one of the Towers.

"Something hit the tower", my sister said. I looked on in silence. I remember analyzing the height of the crash and thinking that ¾ of the people would be able to evacuate. Then I remember realizing there were people stuck in the top ¼ of the building and telling my sister "There's people at the top. How are they going to get down?"

We briefly chatted and soon thereafter we hung up.

The journalists on CNN were franticly trying to explain what had happened and none had explanations to provide. I switched channels and it was the same everywhere: the Tower in smoke and a lot of speculation. After a few minutes, I pressed mute on the TV and rather played music on my computer. I opened my Napster folder, randomly chose "The blood that moves the body" by A-Ha and went in the kitchen to make myself breakfast.

About ten minutes later, I came back to the TV and saw a plane hit the middle of the second Tower. I Froze. Within seconds, the phone rang.

"Did you see that?" My sister asked.

"Yes" I replied

"What's happening?"

"I don't know. I'm just glad I am where I am ... right now".

"What's going to happen?" she asked me nervously.

"I don't know" I told her.

On both ends of our phones, my sister and I watched our TVs silently. Within minutes, she thought out loud, repeating at least three times "This is beyond understanding".

We talked for a while as I drank my coffee. Nervously, she told me she had to go to work and so we hung up. I didn't have any classes that day, but I had homework to do. I just stayed glued to the TV. I stayed there and watched.

I'm unsure if the chronology of events happened the way I'm about to describe it, but I seem to remember President Bush saying that the United States had just suffered a terrorist attack. I had heard the word "terrorism" before, but this was the first time I actually felt the mean of it. I was terrorized. 

Then, if I'm not mistaken, I believe the Pentagon got hit. Although there was no video footage of the crash, reporters claimed a plane had flown in it. I watched the TV and felt mostly paralyzed by the story that was unfolding. My mind was numb.

In its attempt to keep its audience cued in to what was happening, a bunch of CNN reports kept coming and going. No one could make sense of what was happening.

As I looked at the smoke emanating from the second Tower, I once again thought about the individuals above the explosion. This time, the explosion had occurred lower than the previous one, which meant there were more individuals caught inside. "How are they going to get down?" I thought out loud.

Minutes later, I saw things that shocked me to the core: people were jumping out the towers in total desperation. As they plunged willingly to their deaths, I couldn't breath.

Horrified by the scenes I was witnessing, my fearfulness jumped to a level I hadn't felt before: the first Tower came crashing down. 

Within seconds, there was but one tower standing. My shock gave way to disbelief and I could not believe what I was seeing. I distinctively remember thinking, "How can ¼ of a building destroy the remaining ¾ of it?"

My mind was racing. "That's impossible", I told myself. My eyes were telling me something but my mind was not cooperating.

The total destruction of the first tower awoke me from my daze. I attempted to persuade myself that somehow, I was looking at something that wasn't real. I actually told myself that I was watching a really bad movie. For the first time in my life (that I remembered), I was in denial of what was happening. 

Then, the second tower came down.

The story of 911 is as follows: under the direction of Osama Bin Laden, individuals took control of 4 planes. 2 were flown and crashed into the World Trader Center Towers, another in the Pentagon and the last one crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. Under the severity of the explosions, both Towers fell at free fall speeds. The debris of the Towers also caused the collapse of tower \#7\.

Using this story, the United States embarked on the longest war in modern history, a war dubbed "the war on terror" that rages still.

As of now, the "war on terror" has engulfed the lives of thousands upon thousands of individuals, has been the reason behind the biggest refugee crisis mankind has ever known, and is the source of a ballooning $4 Trillion debt load that is nowhere near of stopping.

The "war on terror" has plagued the collective consciousness of millions of individuals and has placed mankind in a perpetual state of war. It has enabled the State to attack civil liberties, massively spend on surveillance programs and new military technologies while increasing the State's presence in our daily lives. All of these actions, we are told, are designed to "keep us safe" from terrorist acts.

The story of 911 changed our lives.

So many things happened since that faithful day. Yet, 911 might not have happened the way we're told it did. If we are able to distance ourselves for it, then we might envision other ways of dealing with the violence we are seeing.

Please bear in mind that I am not one of those who want to know what happened that day. I do not wish to "replace" the story with another. For that, there are hundreds of individuals that have dedicated their lives to unmasking what really happened and I leave it up to them to continue their work in this regard. My goal here is to look at the story and find, if possible, a "Virgin Mary" at the root of it all. 

Independent of what I'm going to write on this story, here is a list of inconsistencies that you may or may not have heard concerning 911:

1\. Bin Laden himself denied having masterminded the attacks.

2\. The architect of the WTC designed the towers to withstand _multiple_

attacks from multiple angles.

3\. The passport of the alleged terrorist that flew one of the planes was magically found in the rubbles.

4\. The collapse of building \#7 cannot have originated from debris alone.

5\. The towers fell at free fall speed, a physical impossibility.

These are just the beginning of a long list of things that form the icing for this incredible story. 

And yet, the "Virgin Mary" in this story doesn't lie (forgive the pun) in the events of New York. It's located in the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.

Much of the story, and our emotional attachment, is located in New York City. It's around the Towers and their collapse. Maybe because of the sheer magnitude of it all, we seem to forget that a third tower also collapsed at free fall speeds, and a plane flew into the Pentagon and another crashed in a field in Pennsylvania.

Ask yourself these questions: of those two planes, how many did we see crash? And of those two, how many did we find? If you hadn't seen a plane crash in the second tower, could you believe a story of a plane that hits the Pentagon but that none was found? Could you somehow believe a story even though no proof existed to support it?

This is where everyone must stay the logical course of reason and "see" the facts as they are.

The facts concerning the Pentagon are rather simple: 1- a plane allegedly hit it, 2- no one saw it and 3- no one found it.

That's how the story goes. Yet, it doesn't end there.

The story actually states a miracle happened. "The airplane vaporized on impact".

Wait, wait, wait ... run that by me again?

"The plane, under the intense heat of the fire from the jet fuel, vaporized". It is materially and physically _impossible _for a plane, it its entirety, to vanish from existence when catching fire.

In much the same manner that a miracle must be relied upon to make Christ come into existence, here a miracle of metaphysic proportion is required to make this story true. Are we to believe that tons of metal and titanium magically went from a solid state to a liquid state to vapor to nothing without leaving any trace?

That's magic.

The truth is simple. No planes hit the Pentagon and even though you want to believe it, there is no proof of it.

Now your left brain may want to find something to replace it. I urge
you to not do this right now because the rabbit hole gets deeper and deeper if
you choose to go there.

For now, just accept that there was no plane and the uncomfortable feelings that might arise.

Remember the proverb: 

_a half-truth is a whole lie_

The only thing we must do is to accept the truth that planes don't vaporize when catching fire. We do not need to come up with a reason or an explanation to disprove the whole story. By simply accepting this basic truth, we thus can reject in its entirety the story of 911\. And by doing so, it relieves us in believing in the rest of the story, or in any action that is deemed appropriate in response to it.

Why bring this up you might ask? I say "why not". 

Why not look at ourselves, our beliefs and how we act?

Ever since this story was told we've been in a state of perpetual war. Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We had to bomb Afghanistan. We had to kill Kaddaffi in Lybia. We had to bomb Pakistan and Yemen. And we must continue.

Now, it's Syria.

At home, this story was the ignition point for the Patriot Act, to domestic spying programs. It was also to driver behind Guantanamo Bay and waterboarding. It is even to trigger to targeted assassinations and to the never-ending erosion of our civil liberties.

Why bring this up? For all of the above and for the millions of individuals that were killed in the process and for the millions of refugees that have seen their lives shattered to pieces. 

We've been at war of 15 years. The suffering is intensifying and yet the remedy is more of the same. More war.

What better place to stop this madness than at the very beginning to
it all?
